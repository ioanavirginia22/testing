# App IT

App IT is a react and react-native app
### How to start the project
The project contains 4 core apps:
- AppItCore
- BackEnd
- Frontend
- Webapp

**You’ll need to have Node 8.9.0 or later on your local development machine** (but it’s not required on the server). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

```sh
$ cd APP-IT 
$ cd AppItCore
$ yarn install
$ cd ..
$ cd Webapp
$ yarn install
$ yarn build - build the prject
```

```sh
$ yarn start
```
- Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
